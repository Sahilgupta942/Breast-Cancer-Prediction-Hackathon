Breast Cancer Prediction Hackathon
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, accounting for nearly 1 in 3 cancers diagnosed among women in the United States, and it is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Breast Cancer occurs as a results of abnormal growth of cells in the breast tissue, commonly referred to as a Tumor. A tumor does not mean cancer - tumors can be benign (not cancerous), pre-malignant (pre-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous). Tests such as MRI, mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy are commonly used to diagnose breast cancer performed.

The dataset is fetched using a diagnosis technique that uses the FNA (Fine Needle Aspiration), which is a quick and simple procedure to perform, which removes some fluid or cells from a breast lesion or cyst with a fine needle similar to a blood sample needle.

This is an analysis of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) DataSet, obtained from Kaggle.  To create the dataset, samples were taken from patients with solid breast masses and an easy-to-use graphical computer program called Xcyt, which is capable of perform the analysis of cytological features based on a digital scan.

Attribute Information:

ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32)
Real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
perimeter
area
smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
symmetry
fractal dimension (“coastline approximation” - 1)


This model shall be helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer.
